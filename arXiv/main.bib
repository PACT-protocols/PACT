	abstract = {We explore relationships between health information seeking activities and engagement with
healthcare professionals via a privacy-preserving analysis of geo-tagged data from mobile devices.  We analyze logs of mobile interaction data stripped of individually identifiable information and location data. The data analyzed consists of time-stamped search queries and distances to medical care centers. We examine search activity that precedes the observation of salient evidence of healthcare utilization
(EHU) (i.e., data suggesting that the searcher is using healthcare resources), in our case taken as queries
occurring at or near medical facilities.
We show that the time between symptom searches and observation of salient evidence of seeking
healthcare utilization depends on the acuity of symptoms. We construct statistical models that make
predictions of forthcoming EHU based on observations about the current search session, prior medical
search activities, and prior EHU. The predictive accuracy of the models varies (65-90%) depending on the
We provide a privacy-preserving methodology that can be used to generate insights about the pursuit of
health information and healthcare. The findings demonstrate how large-scale studies of mobile devices
can provide insights on how concerns about symptomatology lead to the pursuit of professional care.
We present new methods for the analysis of mobile logs and describe a study that provides evidence
about how people transition from mobile searches on symptoms and diseases to the pursuit of
healthcare in the world.},

We analyzed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ({\textquoteleft}lock-downs{\textquoteright}) that are harmful to society. We discuss the ethical requirements for an intervention of this kind.},

abstract="We consider the problem of computing the intersection of private datasets of two parties, where the datasets contain lists of elements taken from a large domain. This problem has many applications for online collaboration. We present protocols, based on the use of homomorphic encryption and balanced hashing, for both semi-honest and malicious environments. For lists of length k, we obtain O(k) communication overhead and O(k ln ln k) computation. The protocol for the semi-honest environment is secure in the standard model, while the protocol for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. We also consider the problem of approximating the size of the intersection, show a linear lower-bound for the communication overhead of solving this problem, and provide a suitable secure protocol. Lastly, we investigate other variants of the matching problem, including extending the protocol to the multi-party setting as well as considering the problem of approximate matching.",
